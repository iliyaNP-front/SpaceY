                    <p className="HetsMainPageContent-Paragraph1">
                        Long before the first star ignited, before planets circled their suns, and even before time itself could be measured, the universe rested in a state of pure potential. In a fraction of a second, an unimaginable event known as the Big Bang set everything into motion. From a point smaller than an atom, space began to expand, carrying with it energy, matter, and the seeds of every galaxy that would one day shine in the night sky. Over billions of years, these cosmic ingredients shaped stars, forged new elements, and gave birth to worlds—among them, our own. The story of how everything began is not just about distant galaxies and ancient light; it is also about us, for the atoms in our bodies were born in the hearts of stars. To understand the universe’s beginning is to glimpse our deepest origins.

                    <p className="HetsMainPageContent-Paragraph2">
                        Around 13.8 billion years ago, the universe began with what we call the Big Bang—not an explosion in space, but the expansion of space itself. In less than a heartbeat, the universe grew from a point smaller than an atom to a vast, rapidly expanding sea of energy. Temperatures were unimaginably high, and matter as we know it did not yet exist. Instead, there were only fundamental particles—quarks, electrons, and photons—swirling in a dense, hot soup.
                    </p>
                    <p className="HetsMainPageContent-Paragraph2">
                        As the universe continued to expand, it began to cool. Quarks combined to form protons and neutrons, laying the foundation for the simplest elements: hydrogen and helium. Within the first three minutes, the basic building blocks of matter had formed, setting the stage for the first atoms, the first stars, and eventually, the galaxies that would shape the cosmos.
                    </p>
                    <p className="HetsMainPageContent-Paragraph2">
                        This was the universe’s first chapter, a moment of creation where the laws of physics, space, and time themselves came into being.

                    <p className="HetsMainPageContent-Paragraph3">
                        In the earliest moments after the Big Bang, the universe was a chaotic ocean of energy and particles. For the first few hundred thousand years, light itself could not travel freely—it was trapped in a dense fog of matter. As the universe expanded and cooled, particles began to settle into order. Protons and electrons combined to form the very first atoms, and the cosmos transitioned from a glowing storm into a clearer space.
                    </p>
                    <p className="HetsMainPageContent-Paragraph3">
                        This shift released the universe’s first light, a faint afterglow that still exists today. Scientists call it the Cosmic Microwave Background, a silent echo from the birth of time, stretched across the entire sky. It is the oldest light we can ever see, a direct window into the infancy of the cosmos.
                    </p>
                    <p className="HetsMainPageContent-Paragraph3">
                        Though the universe was still dark—without stars or galaxies—these early atoms of hydrogen and helium became the raw material from which everything else would emerge. The stage was now set for the first stars to ignite, breaking the cosmic darkness and bringing light to the universe for the very first time.

                        For millions of years after the universe cleared its fog, space remained dark and silent. Then, gravity began its quiet work—pulling together clouds of hydrogen and helium, squeezing them tighter and tighter until the first stars were born. These stars, far larger and hotter than most stars today, lit up the universe with their brilliant glow, ending the cosmic darkness.                    </p>

                        Inside their fiery cores, nuclear fusion forged new elements—carbon, oxygen, and iron—the very ingredients of planets and life. When these giant stars reached the end of their lives, they exploded as supernovae, scattering their newly made elements across space like seeds in a cosmic garden.

                        Over time, stars gathered into immense collections, forming the first galaxies. These vast, spinning islands of stars became the great structures of the universe, stretching across unimaginable distances. Among billions of galaxies, one would eventually give rise to our solar system, and with it, the story of Earth and life itself.
